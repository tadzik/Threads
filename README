Excited already? :) Don't expect too much, it's just me toying around.

But yeah, that works.

Needs fairly recent Parrot (65a44c0c877 at least), built with
--without-threads. Yeah, really :) That'll build Parrot with no OS
threads, which are currently broken in nqp, but green threads, which work
fine. They have the same API, so this module will hopefully still work
when OS threads are fixed.
